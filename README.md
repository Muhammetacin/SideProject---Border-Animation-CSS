# Side Project: CSS Border Animation

The page only has a div element in the middle, centered. It looks like it has a loading bar around it. Infinite looping animation.

## What did I learn?

With this project I have learned how to work with CSS: conic-gradient.

Documentation: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/conic-gradient()>

```CSS
background-image: conic-gradient(transparent 240deg,#ff0052 340deg);
```

Also, I used a different Font for the text inside the div element: 'Ubuntu'. You add the @import tag all the way up in CSS file.

```CSS
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ubuntu&display=swap');

font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;
```

So I learned how to import Fonts online (here I imported this font from Google fonts).
